- Devel::StackTrace incorrectly reported that arguments were being
passed to eval blocks (which isn't possible).  Reported by Mark Dedlow.


1.04  Sep 25, 2003

- The special handling of Exception::Class::Base objects was broken.
This was exposed by the fact that Exception::Class 1.15 now uses
Devel::StackTrace in a slightly different way than it did previously.


1.03  Jan 22, 2003

- Special handling of Exception::Class::Base objects when stringifying
references.  This avoids infinite recursion between the two classes.


1.02  Sep 19, 2002

- Forgot to add Test::More to PREREQ_PM for previous releases.


1.01  Sep 18, 2002

- Change the "no object refs" feature to be a plain old "no refs"
feature.  As was pointed out to me by Jean-Phillippe Bouchard, a plain
reference (to an array, for example), can easily hold references to
objects internally.  And since I'm not going to bother descending
through nested data structures weeding out objects, this is an easier
way to handle the problem.  Thanks to Jean-Phillippe Bouchard for a
patch for this as well.

The "no_object_refs" parameter is deprecated, and now does the same
thing as the "no_refs" parameter.


1.00  Aug 23, 2002 (from Taiwan)

- Add an option to not store references to objects in stack frames.
This can be important if you're expecting DESTROY to be called but a
Devel::StackTraceFrame object is still holding a reference to your
object(s).  Based on discussion with Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.


0.9   Nov 24, 2001

- Doc tweaks.


0.85

- doc bug fix that made it seem like args method was only available
under Perl 5.6.0
- converted objects from pseudo-hashes to regular hashes.


0.8

- Should work under Perl 5.6.0+.
- Added hints & bitmask methods for use under Perl 5.6.0.


0.75

- Added frames method (and docs for it).
- Added 'use 5.005' which I should have put in there earlier.
- DOCS: explanation of 'top' and 'bottom' as they refer to the stack.
