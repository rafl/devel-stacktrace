- Change the "no object refs" feature to be a plain old "no refs"
feature.  As was pointed out to me by Jean-Phillippe Bouchard, a plain
reference (to an array, for example), can easily hold references to
objects internally.  And since I'm not going to bother descending
through nested data structures weeding out objects, this is an easier
way to handle the problem.  Thanks to Jean-Phillippe Bouchard for a
patch for this as well.

- Add an option to not store references to objects in stack frames.
This can be important if you're expecting DESTROY to be called but a
Devel::StackTraceFrame object is still holding a reference to your
object(s).  Based on discussion with Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.
