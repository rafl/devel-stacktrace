Simple objects to deal with stack traces.  The parent object,
Devel::StackTrace, holds a number of Devel::StackTraceFrame objects
(which have the same information as is returned from caller()).  You
can step through these frames forwards and backwards as you want or
retrieve specific frames.

NOTE: This module requires Perl 5.005 or greater.  Also, bugs in Perl
5.6.0 will cause it to fail its test suite and it will probably be
non-functional.  These bugs should be addressed in Perl 5.6.1.
